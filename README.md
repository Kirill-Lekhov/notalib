# pyutil

Collection of small Python utility functions and classes. Some are written by me, some are taken from StackOverflow and customized (I tried to provide links to original sources where possible).

This repo doesn't aim to be library of any sort, I'm just sharing them for easier reuse. Documentation is provided on best-effort basis. Use at your own risk.
